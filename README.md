# Movies- EDA 

## Introduction
This project was done on a cleaned but large database of movies. The database includes titles, cast, director, revenue, budget, ratings etc.

#Task
Explore the database and answer some analytical questions on the movies and franchises.
Write queries and functions to find the most successful movies by different categories (revenue, ratings, profit)

#Takeaways
This project was one of my first with using Pandas. It was very useful being able to use everything I had learned to come up with the answers needed. 
I used matplotlib a few times which was great practice.
