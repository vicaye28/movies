# Movies- EDA 

## Introduction
This project was done on a clean but large database of movies. The database includes titles, cast, director, revenue, budget, ratings etc.

# Task
Explore the database and answer some analytical questions on the movies and franchises.
Write queries and functions to find the most successful movies by different categories (revenue, ratings, profit)

# Takeaways
This project was one of my first to use Pandas. I got to use everything I had learned to find the answers needed. 
I used matplotlib a few times which was great practice.
